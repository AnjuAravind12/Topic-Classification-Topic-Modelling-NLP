Sample output after data collection will look like this
Once you create the dataset, your job is to combine the sentences of three each into a single sentences,along with the 3 labels (Permutation)
Sample output after permutation will look like this
Then next step is to train the dataset which has combination of sentences with 3 Labels to produce a score
Sample output will look like given below
